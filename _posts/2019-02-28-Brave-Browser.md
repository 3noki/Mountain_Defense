For anyone that hates ads, like products that utilize the latest
security features, has plenty of customization, and doesn't look like 1995
Netscape, take a look at Brave here <b><a href="https://brave.com/mou762">https://brave.com/mou762</a></b>

The browser blocks thousands of ads, trackers, cookies, and scripts, easily
turn off a security feature, or the "shields", if it is hindering something on a
site you are visiting. Another built in security feature is blocking auto play
and scripts by default, so you reduce your exposure to accidentaly download any malicious
content.

<p>There's a full list of other features.</p>

  If you still really hate ads, but want support your favorite websites and
authors, or your favorite youtube channel, or even a twitch streamer,
you can! Through BAT, Basic Authentication Token, you can contribute any
amount you want. Currently Brave is distributing grants to encourage adoption,
once they no longer distribute monthly tokens for you to use, you can buy them,
or, you will be able to "opt in" to certain ads, to earn tokens, which you
can then spend at over 250,000 partners with BAT, or re-contribute to content
creators! Take a look at this other<b><a href="https://brave.com/brave-tap-blockchain/"> article</a></b> for other information on the partners.

but if you want to add funds now or later, you can currently contribute Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Litecoin, and of course BAT. See some of my other <b><a href="https://mountaindefense.net/blog/category#crypto">posts</a></b> to learn how

For frequently browsed sites, add them to the tip section through auto contribute,
or remove any sites that were added that you don't really support ;)

I installed this browser in a Linux Debian instance and was not able to initially open the browser.
here's a link to the common<b><a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/6902#issuecomment-374607423">
Debian issue
</a></b> I experienced.
I had to add run this cli command from root;
<br/>
<br/>

<p style="background-color: rgb(236, 236, 236);">
<code>
echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1' > /etc/sysctl.d/00-local-userns.conf
<br/>
service procps restart
</code>

For now you can support your favorite sites for free, soon, for as little as a cup of coffee a month, you can automatically support your favorite
sites without seeing ads, and soon, you'll be able to even earn that by opting into a few ads, creating this nice ecosystem.
