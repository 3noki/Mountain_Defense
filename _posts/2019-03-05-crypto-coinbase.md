While I'm not a big fan of coinbase, they make it darn easy for anyone new to
crypto currencies to buy. Sign up with this link
<b><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5293694b2e44f360bc00036d">https://www.coinbase.com/join/</a></b>
and you can get $10 worth of Bitcoin free. ****if you buy at least $100 of Bitcoin
</p>

Once you are signed up, link an account, a bank accounk may take a few days to verify,
or you can add a credit card and pruchase immediately.

Many services and businesses do accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as regular payments now, but if you are going to buy a service such as a VPN service, and want touse crypto to privately purchase this, don't use tokens/coins you have bought on a main service like Coinbase, addresses can be tracked, unless you use a challenging tumbler service. Use a local Bitcoin ATM, <b><a href="/crypto/2019/03/07/crypto-on-changelly">changelly</a></b>, or search for another anonymous purchasing service.
