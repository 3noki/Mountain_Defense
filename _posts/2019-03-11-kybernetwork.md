Kyber swap, <b><a href="https://kyberswap.com/swap/">kyberswap.com/swap</a></b>, makes it easy to swap your tokens for something else. And, it's a decentralized platform! It's a bit like
<b><a href="https://shapeshift.io">ShapeShift.io</a></b>. When I last used ShapeShift
they were more privacy focused, if you converted a coin/token(s), the coin/token(s)
you received would not be traceable back to you, basically this worked like a tumbler. but now, you need to sign up with ShapeShift.io.
To my current knowledge, Kyber has not implemented this type of feature or it's unknown to me if they will look to add it in the future, but you don't need an account to use Kyber swap.
<br/>

To use Kyber swap, just select your method of funding, and swap for whatever coins/tokens they currently have available to swap for.
