Our team noticed a disconnect between small businesses in town and their
awareness or implementation of any cyber security practices. We decided to help
fill this gap, by brining the front lines cyber security products to your door.

We have extensive experience in Managed Security Services Providers, Threat
Hunting, and working directly with the largest security vendors and companies
in the world, including AT&T, Cisco, Palo Alto, Trend Micro, SentinelOne,
McAfee, FireEye, and many more.

Do not fear, there is an abundance of jargon thrown around in this field in
addition to the vast amount of resources and products. We are here to help you
overcome this challenge and offer specific and catered services to you as a
small business that is worried about both cost, and staying protected.
