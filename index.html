      This is our capstone service, managed security services can get costly,
      especially for small businesses. In addition to the basic model IPS device,
      companies have to tack on extra costs for support, signatures supscription, and maintenance.
      To provide security in an affordable manner,
      or in the absence of firewalls and IPS devices, this service analyses all
      traffic for abnormal and malicious behavior.
      This service helps create a positive security posture to help
